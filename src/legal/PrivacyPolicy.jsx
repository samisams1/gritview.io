      <strong>Disclosure on Your Behalf.</strong>
      <p>
        We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as
        described in this Privacy Policy to fulfill our obligations under our

      <p>
        When you share information through Gritiview.io, that information is
        viewable by you and by anyone else you choose to share it with. If you
        give access to your Gritiview.io account to other applications and
        services, based on your approval, those services would then have access
        to your shared information. The use, collection, and protection of your

      </p>
      <strong>Internal Disclosure.</strong>
      <p>
        We will process your personal data internally within Gritview.io to help
        combine the personal information covered across the different aspects of
        Gritiview.io and our other products and services to help provide
        services to you in a manner that is personalized and useful to you and
        others.

      <strong>Service Providers.</strong>
      <p>
        We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as
        described in this Privacy Policy to contractors, service providers, and
        other third parties we use solely to support Gritiview.io (such as cloud
        hosting, cookie providers, maintenance, analysis, audit, payment, fraud
        detection, communication, and development). For example, some of the
        platforms used to send emails and notifications provided through
        Gritview.io are built and managed by third parties, so some of your
        information is sent securely to those services to provide such
        functionality. They will have access to your information only as
        reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
        obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.

      <strong>Legal Process.</strong>
      <p>
        It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when
        required by law, subpoena, or other legal process. We attempt to notify
        Users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in
        our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the
        request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in
        our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague, or lack proper
        authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand. We may also
        disclose your information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure
        is reasonably necessary to (i) investigate, prevent, or take action
        regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government
        enforcement agencies; (ii) enforce our agreements with you; (iii)
        investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or
        allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of Gritiview.io; or

      <p>
        Your information, including personal data that we collect from you, may
        be transferred to, stored at and processed by us outside the country in
